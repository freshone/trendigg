Twitter Trending Topics Crossref with Digg

The idea of this little app is to take the current trending topics on Twitter
and run a search for each on Digg. In theory the result provides the user
deeper info about whatever Twitter is buzzing about at the moment.

The output is simple HTML.  Each topic is printed, and then a listing of the
Digg article topics is printed with a link to each story.  Simple.
